# Delegator Manual

**Note: This manual assumes familiarity with Ethereum transactions using MetaMask.**

All delegator operations can be done through the SGN web portal([mainnet](sgn.celer.network), [testnet](sgntest.celer.network)). If using testnet, switch to Ropsten on MetaMask.

You can see a list of validators and their status on the homepage. More information of a validator can be found once you click its address.

## Delegate stake

1. Approve CELR to the DPoS contract through the lower left button.

2. Once clicked into a validator, you can see a “Actions” button in the upper right corner. Delegate through “Actions -> Delegate”

## Withdraw stake

1. Input the amount of take to withdraw through “Actions -> Initialize Withdraw”

2. After the mainchain slashTimeout, confirm your withdrawal through “Actions -> Confirm Withdraw”. 

## Claim reward

1. In the reward page, click “Initialize Redeem”

2. Wait for the “collecting signatures” timer to finish, then click “Redeem Reward”
